              Swim, bike, and run. Triathlon is a sport I truly love. It pushes me both physically
              and mentally. But, it also represents a welcome respite from the chaos of everyday life.

              I play acoustic guitar and a Venezuelan instrument similar to the ukulele, which is called
              a "Cuatro." Yes, it's called four (it has four strings). I am currently starting to learn the piano.

              Yes, this is clich√©, but I do enjoy reading a lot, both non-fiction and fiction alike.
              I would say that some of my favorite books are "A Brief History of Time" by Stephen
              Hawking, "Origin" by Dan Brown, "Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors" by Carl Sagan, and "The Count
              of Monte Cristo" by Alexandre Dumas.

            <p class="toggle_information">
              I have only started coding in the past few months, but I can say that it has become
              another hobby of mine. I enjoy coding very much since I find it amazing that just by
              typing on a keyboard you can create programs that can do almost anything you want.

              I always need some time to really relax and pull away from all my obligations, and videogames
              allow just that: immersion in a virtual world where I can almost completely abstract myself
              (pun intended) from the real world.

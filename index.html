            <h3>My story...</h3>
            <p class="general_text">
                I was born and raised in Caracas, Venezuela. I earned my High School diploma at Instituto Educacional
                Henry Clay in Caracas. I am currently a first-year student at Harvard College, planning to
                concentrate in physics, with a possible secondary in astrophysics.

            <h3>Looking ahead</h3>
            <p class="general_text">
                For the future, I plan on going to grad school in physics and conduct research on a field that I have
                still not yet chosen but which I think will probably be either cosmology or quantum information
                technology. My long-term goal would be to earn a faculty position at a university and form my own
                research group. Life is full of changes, and probably more than 50% of what I said here will change
                with time, but I think it is good to at least have a plan :)
